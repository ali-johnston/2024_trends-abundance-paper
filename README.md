Code to create figures for trends-abundance paper exploring eBird trends

## Setup

To install all necessary packages to run the R scripts in the `code/` directory, run the following

```         
install.packages(readLines("requirements.txt"))
```

All R scripts in `code/` assume that the working directory is the top-level project directory, i.e. the one containing this README file. If you are using RStudio, open the `.Rproj` file and your working directory will be set correctly. If you're not using RStudio, you can set your working directory manually, e.g. using

```         
setwd("/Users/Alison/Documents/REPOS/2024-trends-abundance-paper/")
```

## Code

The R scripts included in the `code/` directory of this repository reproduce the figures and results from the paper.

- `figure-01_species-maps.R`: generates trend maps for Great blue heron (Ardea herodias), Wood duck (Aix sponsa), and House wren (Troglodytes aedon) aggregated to three different spatial scales: range-wide, regional (Bird Conservation Region), and landscape scales (27 km Ã— 27 km grid cells).
- `figure-02_fishbone.R`: generates a bar plot showing the minimum, maximum, median, and interquartile range of 27 km trend estimates for each of the 495 species in the study.
- `bam_linear_analysis.R`: Ali to provide a brief description of what this script does. This script generates a set of CSVs that are required by several of the subsequent scripts, therefore, it should be run prior to running the scripts used to generate Figures 3 and S14-S16.
- `figure-03_bam-abd.R`: Ali to provide a brief description of what this script does. Depends on `bam_linear_analysis.R`.
- `figure-04_community-maps.R`: generates community-level trend maps showing the mean trend across species breeding in six different biomes.
- `figure-S01_variation-within-biome.R`: generates a histogram showing the distribution of the range of 27 km trend estimates within each BCR-species combination.
- `figure-S02_trend-vs-prop-range-dec.R`: calculates the range-wide trend and proportion of 27 km grid cells that show a declining trend, then generates a boxplot showing the distribution of the proportion of declining cells binned by range-wide trend. TODO: missing the red box.
- `figure-S03-S04_density-prop-range-dec.R`: generates density plots showing the distribution of range-wide trend and the distribution of the proportion of cells with declining trends. Density plots are grouped by biome and (in Figure S4) split by breeding and non-breeding season trends.
- `figure-S13_rangewide-error.R`: generates a histogram showing the distribution of range-wide error across species.
- `figure-S14-S15_range-edge.R`: generate plots showing the relationship between the trend estimates in 27 km cells and the distance of those cells to the species' range edge: a histogram of the slopes of the relationship for each species and the linear relationships by species grouped by biome. Depends on `bam_linear_analysis.R`.
- `figure-S16_compare-edge-abd.R`: based on the results of the BAM analysis, generates distributions of species-specific effect sizes for (a) distance to range edge and (b) relative abundance when both variables were included in the same model. Depends on `bam_linear_analysis.R`.
- `numbers-for-text.R`: produces a variety of numbers that appear in the text of the paper.

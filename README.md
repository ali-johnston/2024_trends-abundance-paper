Code to create figures for trends-abundance paper exploring eBird trends

## Setup

To install all necessary packages to run the R scripts in the `code/` directory, run the following

```         
install.packages(readLines("requirements.txt"))
```

All R scripts in `code/` assume that the working directory is the top-level project directory, i.e. the one containing this README file. If you are using RStudio, open the `.Rproj` file and your working directory will be set correctly. If you're not using RStudio, you can set your working directory manually, e.g. using

```         
setwd("/Users/Alison/Documents/REPOS/2024-trends-abundance-paper/")
```
